# WNS Triange Hackquest

You are provided with 3 files: training set, test set and sample submission.

The training set contains a diverse dataset of car images, each labeled with information being fraudulent or non fraudulent. The dataset includes images from varying lighting conditions, cluttered backgrounds, long tail distribution, and so on.

In the test set, you are provided with only the images and you need to predict the label as fraudulent or non fraudulent for each image present.

The sample submission file contains the format in which the user needs to submit the solution file.

# Result-
Thank you for exploring this repository. Despite extensive efforts, the models developed for the hackathon did not achieve the desired results. While the final rank in the competition was approximately 70-80(Last I checked), the journey was filled with valuable learning experiences.

Numerous iterations were conducted, experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies. Despite rigorous validation, the models' performance on the test dataset fell short of expectations.One can take this a starting point and contribute.
